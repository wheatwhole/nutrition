				<h1>macromolecules</h1>
				<p>
					A building block of life is <b>macromolecules</b>. Each cell in our bodies and animals'
					bodies contains thousands of these. Some macromolecules that use <b>Carbon</b> are
					<b>proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, DNA,</b>
					and <b>RNA</b>. Every macromolecule has its own "job". The job of a macromolecule depends
					on the <b>Carbon backbone</b> and the groups it has.

		<h2>monomers and polymers</h2>
		<p>
			Macromolecules are split into groups of <b>monomers</b> and <b>polymers</b>. Meaning "many
			monomers", polymers are made up of multiple monomers, and most macromoleceules are polymers.
			<br /><b>Polymers can be broken up</b> by <b>hydrolysis</b> (using the polarity of water to
			break bonds) or <b>combined</b> by <b>dehydration synthesis</b> (removing the water to combine
			things). Every macromolecule is a polymer
		</p>

		<h2>carbohydrates</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Carbohydrates</b> are fuel and building material and are chains of monomers. The way they
			are bound changes their function and specialty, and the formation of a carbohydrate is
			interconnected rings.
			<br /><b>Glycosidic Linkage:</b> covalent bond that connects a carbohydrate to another group of
			carbohydrates.
		</p>

		<h3>monosaccharides</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Fuel</b>; can be converted to other molecules or combined into polymers</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>glucose</b></li>
				<li><b>fructose</b></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>disaccharides</h3>
		<p><b>These are polymers</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Formed through the synthesis of <b>2 monosaccharides</b> by a <b>glycosidic bond</b></li>
			<li>Same function as monosaccharides</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>lactose</b></li>
				<li><b>sucrose</b> (table sugar)</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>polysaccharide</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Polymer</b></li>
			<li><b>Long chain</b> of monosaccharides</li>
			<li>Strengthens cell walls, stores glucose for energy</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>cellulose</b> (plants)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Major structural molecule in plants (<b>linear beta glycosidic bonds</b> are very rigid)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>starch</b> (plants)</li>
				<li><b>chitin</b> (insects and fungi)</li>
				<li><b>glycogen</b> (animals)</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h2>lipids</h2>
		 <p>Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules The formation of all lipids is chains, and they are important for <b>energy storage</b> and <b>cell membranes</b>. The function of a lipid depends on its structure</p>
            <p>Some lipids are fats, phospholipids, and cholesterol.</p>
		<ul>
           
			<li><b>Glycerol Backbone:</b> Contains Hydrogen, Carbon, and Oxygen. The start of all lipids</li>
			<li><b>Fatty Acids:</b> The body of lipids and contains the same elements as the glycerol backbone but arranged differently</li>
		</ul>

            <img src="/illustrations/fats.png" alt="fats illustration" class="illustration" />

				<h3>Fats</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Fats</b> are made up of <b>3 fatty acid monomers</b> joined to a
					<b>glycerol backbone</b>
					by <b>ester bonds</b>. You may have seen these on food labels.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Saturated Fats</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The acids are <b>packed tightly together</b>, making them
							<b>solid at room temperature</b>
						</li>
						<li>Store the most energy</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Unsaturated Fats</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Due to the presence of a <b>double bond</b>, the acids are not packed tightly
							together, making them <b>liquid at room temperature</b>
						</li>
						<li>Easier for your body to break down</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

		<h3>Phospholipids</h3>
		<img
			src="/illustrations/phospholipid.png"
			alt="phospholipids illustration"
			class="illustration"
		/>
		<p>
			These make up <b>strong cell membranes</b> and each one has a
			<b>hydrophilic (water attracted) head</b>
			and <b>hydrophobic (water repelling) tail</b>. When phospholipids are added to water, they
			<b>self-assemble into a bilayer</b>, with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the interior.
		</p>

		<h3>Cholesterol</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Steroid</b></li>
			<li><b>Interconnected C-ring formation</b></li>
			<li>Found in <b>cell membranes</b>, <b>myelin sheath</b></li>
			<li>Maintains <b>membrane fluidity</b> and <b>structural support</b></li>
			<li>
				Precursor to <b>vitamin D</b> and steroid hormones like
				<b>testosterone, estrogen, cortisol</b>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>proteins</h2>
		<p><b>Have many functions</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Regulate reactions as <b>enzymes</b></li>
			<li>Form <b>muscle</b> and other structures</li>
			<li>Transport substances into and out of the cell</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>amino acids</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Monomers</b></li>
			<li>Bonded by <b>peptide bonds</b></li>
			<li>
				The <b>R-group</b> an amino acid has determines its structure and function. There are
				<b>20 different types</b> of R-groups
			</li>
			<li><strong>Polypeptide chains: </strong> chains of amino acids and a precursor to proteins. A polypeptide chain is the linear sequence, while the protein is the functional and folded 3-D structure</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>levels of protein organization/structure.</h3>
        <img src="/illustrations/proteinstructures.png" alt="protein structures" class="illustration" />
		<ul>
			<li><b>Primary structure:</b> Linear sequence of amino acids</li>
			<li>
				<b>Secondary structure:</b> Regular/repeated configurations caused by <b>H-bonding</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Tertiary structure:</b> Intricate 3-D structure from interactions between
				<b>R-groups</b>; greatly impacted by earlier levels
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Quaternary structure:</b> Structure formed from interaction of
				<b>2 or more polypeptides</b>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>denaturation</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Alterations</b> in pH, salt concentration, temperature, or other environmental factors
				can cause a protein to unravel. As a result the protein
				<b>loses its structure and function</b> 😢
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>nucleic acids</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Nucleic acids</b> (the polymers) are made up of a chain of <b>nucleotides</b> (the
			monomers)<br />
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>DNA</b></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Deoxyribonucleic acid</li>
				<li>
					This is the <b>genetic material</b> of all living organisms. Primary part of our chromosomes
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>RNA</b></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Ribonucleic acid</li>
				<li>
					This <b>transcribes (copies)</b> the genetic info in DNA and <b>turns it into proteins</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A <b>phosphate group</b> is a <b>phosphorus atom bonded to 4 oxygen atoms</b>. It's crucial as
			it's the <b>backbone of RNA and DNA</b>.
