        <h1>carbon</h1>
        <p>A building block of life is macromolecules. Some macromolecules that use Carbon are proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, DNA, and RNA. Most of the macromolecules that organisms consume are organic. To be organic means that the molecule contains carbon to carbon bonds. Carbon is an extremely important element, because its the backbone of macromolecules. Carbon's tetravalance allows it to connect with 4 other atoms, making it super versatile. This versatility allows it to form the wide variety of macromolecules. </p>
    <p> Every macromolecule has its own "job". The job of a macromolecule depends on the Carbon backbone and the groups it has.</p>
